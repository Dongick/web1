<h2>JavaScript</h2>
The JavaScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O),
such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities. In practice,
the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.
JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but they are
now core components of other software systems, most notably servers and a
variety of applications.
Although there are similarities between JavaScript and Java, including
language name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two languages
are distinct and differ greatly in design.
